## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

For the temperature datasets, we will analyze the changes between 18th century and the 21st century and determine if these datasets can validate that climate change is in fact a real problem we are facing today. We will also try to determine how the temperature change may have an impact on Indigenous community and wildlife.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We will be using a combination of datasets to anaylyze how a change in temperature has affected the country of Canada. The datasets we will be using include a biodiversity richness dataset comparing indigenous managed lands vs other protected areas, and the temperature dataset collected around Canada range from the years 1917 to 2017.

Biodiversity richness dataset:
This repository accompanies the journal article titled Vertebrate biodiversity on Indigenous-managed lands in Australia, Brazil, and Canada equals that in protected areas. This publication was written by Richard Schuster, Ryan Germain, Joe Bennett, Nicholas J Reo, and Peter Arcese. Contributors created this dataset from various sources, including the Global Administrative Areas database, World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), Natural Resources Canadaâ€™s Aboriginal Lands map layer, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species and Birdlife International threatened species data. The repository consists of GIS shapefiles, and R files including the data analysis used in the paper. The repository was created in January 2017, and has been updated as of november 2020,with the accompanying article published in the journal of environmental science and policy in November 2019. The purpose of this dataset is to acknowledge indigenous land stewardship and its positive impacts on biodiversity and conservation, and better understand how these methods of land stewardship can help countries like Canada, Brazil and Australia meet international treaty targets relating to biodiversity loss, conservation and habitat protection. The researchers created part of the data by creating 10,000 randomly located points in each country that are non-protected areas to compare to the existing data on different types of protected areas. The remaining data was collected according to standards outlined by each organization or government. The IUCN red-list process involves approved partners submitting species assessments (completed by humans) to be published, assessments are managed through the IUCN Species Information Service (SIS). Data from Birdlife International is collected by partners (completed by humans) using their criteria and stored in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (WDKBA) and BirdLife Data Zone. The administrative boundaries used are determined by Indigenous Nations and the federal government of Canada.
