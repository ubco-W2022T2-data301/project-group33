## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

For the temperature datasets, we will analyze any fluctuations we find that occur between 1917 and 2017. We will also determine if these datasets are capable of validating the fact that climate change is a real issue that is occuring worldwide. We will also try to determine if climate change may have had an impact on Indigenous community and the wildlife local to BC, Canada and provide sustainable solutions where possible.

Canadian Temperature datasets:
We will be using a combination of climate change datasets to anaylyze how the change in temperature has affected Canada over the given years. The datasets we will be using include the temperature data collected by weather stations around Canada over the years of 1917 to 2017. This dataset has a public domain license. This dataset was collected by a climate activist from the [climate.weather.gc.ca](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/prods_servs/cdn_climate_summary_e.html) webpage.

Biodiversity richness dataset:
This repository accompanies the journal article titled Vertebrate biodiversity on Indigenous-managed lands in Australia, Brazil, and Canada equals that in protected areas. This publication was written by Richard Schuster, Ryan Germain, Joe Bennett, Nicholas J Reo, and Peter Arcese. Contributors created this dataset from various sources, including the Global Administrative Areas database, World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), Natural Resources Canadaâ€™s Aboriginal Lands map layer, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species and Birdlife International threatened species data. The repository consists of GIS shapefiles, and R files including the data analysis used in the paper. The repository was created in January 2017, and has been updated as of november 2020,with the accompanying article published in the journal of environmental science and policy in November 2019. The purpose of this dataset is to acknowledge indigenous land stewardship and its positive impacts on biodiversity and conservation, and better understand how these methods of land stewardship can help countries like Canada, Brazil and Australia meet international treaty targets relating to biodiversity loss, conservation and habitat protection. The researchers created part of the data by creating 10,000 randomly located points in each country that are non-protected areas to compare to the existing data on different types of protected areas. The remaining data was collected according to standards outlined by each organization or government. The IUCN red-list process involves approved partners submitting species assessments (completed by humans) to be published, assessments are managed through the IUCN Species Information Service (SIS). Data from Birdlife International is collected by partners (completed by humans) using their criteria and stored in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (WDKBA) and BirdLife Data Zone. The administrative boundaries used are determined by Indigenous Nations and the federal government of Canada.

Wellbeing Index dataset:
The Community Wellbeing Index (CWI) is an assessment of socio-economic indicators across different communities in Canada. The data in these assessments are derived from the Census of Population, which is overseen by Statistics Canada. The wellbeing index scores have four main indicators: education, labour force activity, income and housing. This specific dataset was created and published by Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada so that the scores of indigenous communities can be compared with those of non-indigenous communities. The scores are made based on the results of the 1981-2006 and 2016 census and the 2011 National Household Survey. These surveys are conducted by humans and the information is managed by Statistics Canada.
