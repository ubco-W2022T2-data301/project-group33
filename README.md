# Group 33 - Climate Change

- Your title can change over time.

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We will be analyzing some datasets for temperature changes between 18th century and the 21st century and determine if these datasets can validate that climate change is in fact a real problem we are facing today. We will also try to determine how the temperature change may have an impact on Indigenous community and wildlife.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We will be using a combination of datasets such as a biodiversity richness dataset comparing indigenous managed lands vs other protected areas. Another dataset referenced below include Worldwide temperature data, though our focus if possible will be specific to British Columbia, Canada. The years we will be looking at will range from 1750 to 2017.
