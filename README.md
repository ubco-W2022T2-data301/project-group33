- Your title can change over time.

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We will be analyzing datasets that include the temperature ranges from the 18th century to the 21st century and determine if these datasets can validate that climate change is in fact a real problem we are facing today. We will also try to determine how the temperature change may have an impact on various Indigenous communities around British Columbia, Canada.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The datasets referenced below include Worldwide temperature data, though our focus, if possible, will be specific to British Columbia. The years with which this data is gathered range from 1750 to 2017.
