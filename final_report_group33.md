## Introduction
#### This data analysis was done using datasets from the data.world, which provided monthly weather data from Canada from 1917-2023. This original data frame included 24 columns of various climate values and identifiers. The dataset was pared down to include latitude, longitude, location name, temperature, precipitation, and snowfall. The idea was to use this data to observe and make predictions about changes in mean values throughout the years, and how different values will interact with each other, both within and across seasons. This analysis provides insight into climate change and variability, and some overall insights into how weather patterns interact. Our group also looked at biodiversity richness across different land management types, and a community well-being index provided by the Canadian Census.

## Exploratory Data analysis
#### Some exploration done in this data set required visualizing all of the climate variables across January in order to look for patterns. 
#### The biodiversity richness dataset required linking attributes of the data like biodiversity richness and percent on indigenous lands or protected area to  geographic areas, and then comparing information from different countries or different types of animals.

## Question 2
#### How do climate values interact with one another? Is one value predictive of another? With this question I wanted to explore how climate values might covary. My hypothesis was that warmer years would likely coincide with more precipitation and less snow, and colder years might result in less precipitation and snow. I chose to take all of my values from winter(January), to keep this variable constant.

## Results 2
#### Visualisations of temperature versus snow, and temperature versus precipitation showed some patterns, with lower temperatures being predictive of lower snowfall values, as well as lower precipitation values from 2011- 2018. The pattern appears to reverse after this point, making it difficult to make any concrete statements about the interaction. Precipitation and snowfall appeared to covary across the years, with high precipitation years correlating with high snowfall years overall. This leads me to the thought that precipitation and snowfall values are often correlated, but temperature interactions are more complex, and would require a longer projection to comment on effectively.


## Question 3
#### How does biodiversity richness compare amongst different land management types (across the three countries, and in Canada)
## Results 3
#### Indigenous land management resulted in higher or near equal levels of biodiversity richness than protected areas, and out-perfromed the random non-protected areas across all factors. Indigenous lands are important habitats especially in the 'near threatened' category of animals. Birds especially find refuge in Indigenous lands, with some species having almost 100% of their habitat found in indigenous lands. Even though the total amount of indigenous lands is smaller than protected areas, there is richer biodiversity and the animals most at risk are fairing better in indigenous lands than other areas (based on biodiversity richness score). This is interesting, as indigneous lands typically do not have the 'official' goal of conservation like protected areas do, but due to the ways they're are managed a greater number of life-forms can be supported in indigenous lands, which contrasts with the random areas with no protection which have the lowest bio-diversity across the board. 

## Summary/Conclusion
#### Some take aways from this analysis include an increased awareness for the complexities of climate interactions. While some patterns can be gleaned from short term projections, it is not likely that real and meaningful conclusions can be reached using short term data. Further analysis should include longer projections, and data taken across more seasons, in order to support and add to patterns that were seen in this analysis. 
#### This project helped illustrate how further work could be done to link the human and environmental elements of climate change, and to be creative in how to find indicators of change. By seeing how much indigenous land management makes a difference in how many species can coexist in a place, and how much lower biodiversity is in areas that have no protection at all, it would be worthwhile to find ways to expand indigenous stewardship in order to help bring these benefits to a larger scale. It would have been ideal to link the biodiversity data with the community wellbeing index to show inter-relations between the human experience of climate change, but those skills would be more advanced than the level we are currently at.
